Questions Addressed:
Basic Level Questions:
                1.	What is the total number of COVID-19 deaths for each country?
                2.	How many vaccinations have been administered in each country?
                3.	What are the daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 over a specified period?
                4.	What is the death rate (percentage of deaths to confirmed cases) for each country?
                5.	What percentage of the population in each country has been infected with COVID-19?
                6.	What is the total number of people vaccinated as of a specific date?
                7.	How many deaths occurred each month globally?
                8.	How has the daily count of vaccinations changed over time?
                9.	Which countries have the highest and lowest total cases reported?
                10.	What is the total number of COVID-19 deaths per continent?

Medium Level Questions:
                1.      How does the death rate differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals?
                2.      What are the death counts segmented by age groups across different countries?
                3.      Is there a correlation between vaccination rates and death rates in various countries?
                4.      How do weekly averages of new cases and deaths compare over time?
                5.      Which regions within countries have the highest case counts?
                6.      What is the cumulative vaccination rate compared to total population size across regions?
                7.      What are the recovery rates (percentage recovered to confirmed cases) for each country?
                8.      How have death rates changed over time in specific countries or regions?
                9.      Which continent has the highest infection rate relative to its population size?
                10.     How does the vaccination rate (percentage of people vaccinated) correlate with death rates across different locations?

Advacned Level Questions:
                1.      How can we use historical data to forecast future COVID-19 cases and deaths for the next month?
                2.      Is there a significant time lag between vaccination rollouts and decreases in death rates across different regions?
                3.      Calculate the correlation coefficient between new_cases and new_deaths for each location.
                4.      How do new COVID-19 case rates compare between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations over time across different locations?
                5.      How can we classify countries into COVID-19 hotspots based on key pandemic indicators such as total cases, total deaths, new cases,                                 hospitalizations, testing rates, and vaccinations?
                6.      How can we analyze disparities among different demographic groups in COVID-19 outcomes based on age distribution, healthcare accessibility,                         economic factors, and disease prevalence across countries?
                7.      Analyze the temporal patterns in vaccine distribution, including the rolling average of new vaccinations and the vaccination rate per                               population.
                8.      Analyze survival trends based on ICU and hospitalization data, including rolling averages and mortality rates.
                9.      Analyze the network of infection spread across different locations by evaluating infection density, spread rate, mortality, and government                          intervention effectiveness.
                10.     Can we detect a structural break in COVID-19 case trends to identify when significant changes occurred in transmission rates?
